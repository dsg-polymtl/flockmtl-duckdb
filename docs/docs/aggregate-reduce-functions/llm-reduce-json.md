# llm_reduce_json Aggregate Function

The `llm_reduce_json` function in FlockMTL consolidates multiple rows of text-based results into a single JSON output. It is used in SQL queries with the `GROUP BY` clause to combine multiple values into a summary or reduced form.

## 1. **Usage Examples**

### 1.1. **Example without `GROUP BY`**

Summarize all product descriptions into one single result:

```sql
SELECT llm_reduce_json(
    {'model_name': 'gpt-4'},
    {'prompt': 'Summarize the following product descriptions'},
    {'product_description': product_description}
) AS product_summary
FROM products;
```

**Description**: This example aggregates all product descriptions into one summary. The `llm_reduce_json` function processes the `product_description` column for each row, consolidating the values into a single summarized output.

### 1.2. **Example with `GROUP BY`**

Group the products by category and summarize their descriptions into one for each category:

```sql
SELECT category,
       llm_reduce_json(
           {'model_name': 'gpt-4'},
           {'prompt': 'Summarize the following product descriptions'},
           {'product_description': product_description}
       ) AS summarized_product_info
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

**Description**: This query groups the products by category (e.g., electronics, clothing) and summarizes all product descriptions within each category into a single consolidated summary.

### 1.3. **Using a Named Prompt with `GROUP BY`**

Leverage a reusable named prompt for summarization, grouped by category:

```sql
SELECT category,
       llm_reduce_json(
           {'model_name': 'gpt-4', 'secret_name': 'azure_key'},
           {'prompt_name': 'summarizer', 'version': 1},
           {'product_description': product_description}
       ) AS summarized_product_info
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

**Description**: This example uses a pre-configured named prompt (`summarizer`) with version `1` to summarize product descriptions. The results are grouped by category, with one summary per category.

### 1.4. **Advanced Example with Multiple Columns and `GROUP BY`**

Summarize product details by category, using both the product name and description:

```sql
WITH product_info AS (
    SELECT category, product_name, product_description
    FROM products
    WHERE category = 'Electronics'
)
SELECT category,
       llm_reduce_json(
           {'model_name': 'gpt-4'},
           {'prompt': 'Summarize the following product details'},
           {'product_name': product_name, 'product_description': product_description}
       ) AS detailed_summary
FROM product_info
GROUP BY category;
```

**Description**: In this advanced example, the query summarizes both the `product_name` and `product_description` columns for products in the "Electronics" category, generating a detailed summary for that category.

## 2. **Input Parameters**

### 2.1 **Model Configuration**

- **Parameter**: `model_name` and `secret_name`

#### 2.1.1 Model Selection

- **Description**: Specifies the model used for text generation.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  { 'model_name': 'gpt-4' }
  ```

#### 2.1.2 Model Selection with Secret

- **Description**: Specifies the model along with the secret name to be used for authentication when accessing the model.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  { 'model_name': 'gpt-4', 'secret_name': 'your_secret_name' }
  ```

### 2.2. **Prompt Configuration**

Two types of prompts can be used:

1. **Inline Prompt**

   - Directly provides the prompt in the query.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     {'prompt': 'Summarize the following product descriptions'}
     ```

2. **Named Prompt**

   - Refers to a pre-configured prompt by name.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     {'prompt_name': 'summarizer'}
     ```

3. **Named Prompt with Version**
   - Refers to a specific version of a pre-configured prompt.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     {'prompt_name': 'summarizer', 'version': 1}
     ```

### 2.3. **Column Mappings (Optional)**

- **Key**: Column mappings.
- **Purpose**: Maps table columns to prompt variables for input.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  {'product_name': product_name, 'product_description': product_description}
  ```

## 3. **Output**

- **Type**: Text (string).
- **Behavior**: The function consolidates multiple rows of text into a single output, summarizing or combining the provided data according to the model's response to the prompt.

**Output Example**:  
For a query that aggregates product descriptions, the result could look like:

- **Input Rows**:

  - `product_name`: _"Running Shoes"_
  - `product_name`: _"Wireless Headphones"_
  - `product_name`: _"Smart Watch"_

- **Output**:  
  `"A variety of products including running shoes, wireless headphones, and smart watches, each designed for comfort, convenience, and performance in their respective categories."`
